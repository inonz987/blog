My primary focus is around HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Angular, and Frontend Performance in general.

Beside web development, I am also into books, photography, [building mechanical keyboards](https://armno.in.th/2017/08/20/building-custom-mechanical-keyboard/) and [road bike cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/3637623).
